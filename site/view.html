		<article><br><p>I have two main views in life I think everyone should live by which are:</p>
			<p><h2>1. Financial independence</h2>
			Financial independence is the status of having enough income to pay one's living expenses for the rest of one's life without having to be employed or dependent on others. Income earned without having to work a job is commonly referred to as passive income.<br><img src="https://cdnblog.etmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Financial-Freedom.jpg" height="200px"></p>
			<p> <h2>2. Golden Circle</h2>
			The Golden Circle is a concept developed by Simon Sinek who says, “people don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it.” According to Sinek, most people communicate by starting with the “what” they do aspect and eventually work their way back to talk about “how” and “why” they do what they do.<br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2144/0*jHs1vAXkFMqPsmT6." height="200px"></p>
